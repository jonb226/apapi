THE RUGBY FOOTBALL TEAM FOR AUSTRALIA.                               
Wb give nu illustration from a photograph taken on bonrcl            
tile steamer by Mr. A. Willis, of Gravesend, of the Rugby            
players who started on the 1st for Australia. In doing so we         
desire to express no opinion one way or the other on the ques¬       
tion of the amntcnr status of the team, which will doubtless         
be further considered by the Union at the proper time. Tho           
twenty-one players forming tile contingent comprise three            
Internationals- U. L. Scddon and II. Eagles (Swinton), and           
W. H. Thomas (Cambridge University and Wales). The other             
men arc:---J. T. Haslam and A. Paul (backs), H. 0. Speak-            
man, Ur. H. Brooks, and J. Andcrton (three-quarter-backs);           
W. Burnley, J. Nolan, and W. Burnett (half-backs): G.                
Math.rs, J. Williams, T. Banks, A. J. Stuart, J. P. Clowes,          
T. Kent, A. P. Pinbetli, R. Burnett, A. J. Luing, and Dr. J.         
Smith (forwards). Lancashire has contributed a large propor¬         
tion of these gentlemen; Swinton is represented by five of           
them, while Salford furnishes three and Rochdale one; York¬          
shire sends four, Wales one, three are from Hawick, two              
from Edinburgh University, and one from the Isle of Man.             
Of the whole, Dr. Smith is, perhaps, the best known, but
