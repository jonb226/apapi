Federal prosecutors, who ini-tially said after the plea hearingthat the agreement would leavethe Ameses penniless, agreed notto try to seize the couple's real es-tate in Colombia apparently as alast-minute concession to over-come Rosario Ames' reluctance topleading guilty with her husband.  The properties include a coastalfarm in a rural area of the coun-try, an apartment in Bogot~~ and avacation apartment in a historicdistrict of the seaside city of Car-tagena.  Prosecutors have never placed adollar value on the properties andone official said Saturday thatthey were heavily mortgaged.
