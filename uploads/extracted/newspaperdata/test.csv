"newspaperimage.jpg", "THE RUGBY FooTBALL TEAL; Fen AU€&quot;FnAL1A.\nXV; give an illustration from a photograph taken on board\nthe steamer by Mr. A. &quot;Willis, of Gravesend, of the Rugby\nplayers who started on the 1st for Australia. In doing so we.\ndesire to express no opinion one way or t•he other on the ques-\nlion of the amateur status of the team, which will doubtless\nbe further considered by the Union at the proper time. The\ntwenty-one players forming the contingent; comprise three\nInternationals-;lt. L. Seddon and 1;I. Eueles (Swinton), and\nXV. H. Thomas (Cambridge University and&apos;Wules). The other\nmen are :-J. &apos;l&apos;. Haslam and A. Paul (bucks), H. 0. Speak-\n1nan, Dr. H. Brooks, and J. Andcrton (three-quarter-backs) ;\nXV. Burnley, J. Nolan, and XV. Burnett (half-backs); U.\nMuth.rs, J. XVillia1ns, T. Banks, A. J. Stuart, J. 1&apos;. Clowcs,\nKent, A. I&apos;. Pinbeth, 1t. Burnett, A. J. Laing, and Dr. J.\nSmith (forwards). Lancashire has contributed a large propor-\ntion of t-hose gentlemen ; Swinton is represented by five of\nthem, while Salford furnishes three and Rochdale one ; York-\nshire sends four, W&apos;a1es one, three are from Hawick, two\nfrom Edinburgh University, and one from the Isle of Man.\nOf the whole, Dr. Smith is, perhaps, the best known, but\nprincipally in connection with the Association game. He\naccompanies the team ns umpire. Haslam has sometimes\ndone good work for Batley. ])1•. Brooks was captain of the\nEdinburgh University team in 1882, and is at present captain\nof the Durham County Club. Nolan has appeared to advan-\ntage with the Rochdale Hornets ; Banks has played promi-\nnently for Swinton and Lancashire, and Kent for Salford and\nthe North against the South. Speukman is well known&apos; in\nCheshire. Of the Internationals, Seddon and Eugles have up\nto the present done most work."
